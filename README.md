# Cleveland GiveCamp Badge Generator

This generates a PDF from a CSV file that includes each attendees
first name, last name, and team designation. Each badge on the PDF
is 3.5 x 2 inches and the PDF is designed to be printed on 8.5 x 11
sized paper.

If you have node installed, you can run `npm install` (or `yarn install`)
and then run the application with `npm start` (or `yarn start`).
